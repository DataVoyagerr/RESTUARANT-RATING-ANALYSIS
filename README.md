## Introduction
---
This is a restaurant rating report. It is a Capstone Project for my final training with Digitaley Drive Data Analytics Education. This project is to analyze and draw out meaningful insight and answer crucial questions that would aid business entrepreneurs and investors in making more informed data driven decisions.

## Problem Statement
---
This analysis will showcase the highest rated restaurants, the effect of consumer preferences on ratings and orders.
1.	What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings?
2.	What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?
3.	Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?
4.	If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?
